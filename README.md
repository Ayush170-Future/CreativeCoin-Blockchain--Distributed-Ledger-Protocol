# CreativeCoin-CryptoToken-Blockchain

CreativeCoin is a CryptoToken made on a Blockchain which is written in Python using Flask web framework for connecting to web using APIs.

About the Token and Blockchain:
It is a naive copy of Bitcoin with 3 nodes in the network(nodes communications are needed to be done manually) which uses Proof of Work as a consensus algorithm with static difficulty(target) of '0000' for the miners.

Mining Operations on my i5 11 gen laptop:
Target 1 - '0000' difficulty takes 1 sec to mine a single block.
Target 2 - '00000000' difficulty takes 67 mins to mine a single block.
These are done manually by myself, other timings can be easily calculated by using the above data(for my laptop only).
